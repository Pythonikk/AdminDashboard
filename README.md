# Admin Dashboard

A full page layout for an admin dashboard, provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) in their Intermediate HTML & CSS course. 

The task was to recreate [this design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/html_css/grid-lessons/project-dashboard/dashboard-project.png) using CSS grid. I followed the design closely with some personal touches like font, images, colors, etc. The layout I replicated exactly.
